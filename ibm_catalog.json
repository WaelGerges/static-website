It uses the IBM Cloud terraform provider to create the following:\n\n- A Cloud Object Storage (COS) bucket configured for public web access\n- A toolchain that provides a hosted Gitlab repo to store a static website html\n- A simple pipeline that copies that html to the Cloud Object Storage bucket when the main branch is updated\n\nThe result is a simple static website with its source stored in a Gitlab repository that automatically updates when that repo is updated."
